# 📝 Live Next-Word Prediction with LSTM

This project implements a **Live Next-Word Prediction** system using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models. It takes user input and predicts the next possible word based on a pre-trained NLP model.

## 🚀 Features
- **LSTM-Based Model:** Uses a deep learning model for sequential word prediction.
- **Custom Model & Tokenizer Loading:** Load your own trained model and tokenizer.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built using **Streamlit** for an interactive experience.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7). Install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install streamlit tensorflow numpy pickle5
```

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Next-Word-Prediction.git
cd Next-Word-Prediction
```

### Run the Application
```sh
streamlit run next_word_prediction_app.py
```
